To install run first

   sudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit libmpfr-dev

If planning on using MPI then install whatever version of
MPI is appropriate. Note that it has to match on the computers
that will be part of the MPI cluster. 

To compile type the standard

   ./configure
   make

For help type ./zetacalc --help
If running with mpi then run

   mpirun ./zetacalc [your options]

instead of

   ./zetacalc [your options]

For maximum performance one should play with the options
--number_of_cpu_threads and --number_of_gpu_threads .
Those parameters should be selected in such a way so that
the utilization of the GPU is maximized, as shown by the
command nvidia-smi while running the program
